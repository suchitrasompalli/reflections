Git - version control - free open source, distributed. Has tiny footprint with fast performance
[outclasses CVS, Subversion with features like cheap local branching, staging areas, multiple workflows]

GitHub - code sharing and collaboration
 

Git versus Google Docs 

Main feature is Google docs saves automatically and is applied to single documents.
Git requires Commit command before it is saved and the commit applies to mulitple files.

Git bash commands.
git --version
git clone "url"
cd to the cloned directory
git log
git diff WantedCommitID PreviousCommitID [Note -- order matters]

git init -- to make any directory you like git ready. It puts a .git directory in that location.
0 commit when file is first initialized

Branches - maybe you want to do an expiremental version and keep it separate from main features.
Master is the main branch.
git branch "branchName"
git checkout branchName
